# Apply Lightweight Fine-Tuning to a Foundation Model

This project demos how to use Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) to fintune a foundation model in order to improve the accuracy for machine learning tasks. 

Built whith Python and Jupyter notebook.

## Python dependencies
datasets
transformers
torch
