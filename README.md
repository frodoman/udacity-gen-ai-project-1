# Project: Apply Lightweight Fine-Tuning to a Foundation Model

This project demos how to use Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) to fintune a foundation model in order to improve the accuracy for machine learning tasks. 

It is developed whith Python in Jupyter Notebook.

## Python dependencies
* datasets
* transformers
* torch
* numpy
* peft
* huggingface-hub


## How to run
After all the dependencies are installed, 
launch Jupyter notebook and double click the 'ApplyLightweightFine-TuningToFoundationModel-1.ipynb' file.
